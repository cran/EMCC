+++ the user-provided function logTarDensFunc takes only one argument
draws, which is the cluster indicator vector. The future plan is to
pass it two arguments, clusterLabels and clusters, i.e., the partition
representation of draw. This will eliminate the R-level use of the
partitionRep function in the implementation of the
logTarDensFunc. This will hopefully make things faster.
