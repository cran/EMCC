BUG FIXES

    o   The package was failing several R CMD check tests due to changes
    	in C++ related includes



NOTES

   o	Now the examples run faster than before and hence they are out of
   	\donotrun{}, the test code for placeTempers is in \donottest{}
	
	
	
   o	The max.iters and nstart arguments for the kmeans function in the
   	examples were reduced to 1000 and the number of iterations of the EMCC
	functions in the examples was reduced to <= 100
